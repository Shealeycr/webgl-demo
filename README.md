Welcome to a simple demo I made with Three.js.  
To run this demo, download the files from this repo, and open the webGLindex.html file in Google Chrome.  
This program demonstrates using raycasting to highlight, select, and move objects in 3D space.  
Press and hold left click to move the camera's target on the grid.  
Press and hold right click to rotate the camera's angle.  
Hover over an object to highligt it, then left click on the object to select it.  
Once an object is selected, directional arrows will appear in the 3D space.  
Select these arrows by hovering over them with the mouse, and click and drag the object.  
Click anywhere in the blank 3D space to deselect an object.
